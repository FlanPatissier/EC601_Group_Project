# EC601 - VQA - For Visually Impaired


**EC-601 HW 1** 
---------------

Literature review of VQA. This includes researching data sets and different architectures used previously as well as the newest state of the art models. 
It also includes a detailed review of the different methods used depending on the type of problem that is being tackled.

**VQA Sprint 1** 
-----------------

Defined our project user stories, as well as the evolution of research that has been done in VQA for visually impaired. A list of architectures has been chosen for us to begin looking into and training. Visit [VQA-Sprint1.pdf](https://github.com/mkhalil1998/EC601_Group_Project/blob/main/VQA-Sprint1.pdf) for more details. 

**VQA Sprint 2** 
-----------------

Were able to sucessfully train three models, one of which is the state of the art models and show the training and validation results. Also some testing was done to understand the flexibilities of the model being trained.
